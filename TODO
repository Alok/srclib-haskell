█ Remove the code for preprocess-haskell from this source tree.
	█ Read about the sanest way to depend against a local library.

█ Improve the test suite.
	█ Interactive testing with srcco.
		█ Get fast test iterations set up.
	█ I should start doing loose TDD style testing. It makes a ton of
	  sense with this type of program.
█ Handle `MachDeps.h` and `ghcautoconf.h` better.
	█ Right now, all the definitions from these files are included
	  via CPP.preInclude.
	█ Because of that, whenever a source files does #include
	  "MachDeps.h", a warning is printed to stderr.
	█ It would be better to handle this by generating a temporary
	  directory with these files in it, and then adding that directory to the
	  search path for header files.
		█ We would first need to varify that these macros
		  are never used without importing those headers. This is
		  probably true, but it would cause regressions if it isn't true.

█ Strictly separate depresolve from graphing.
  █ Formaize the information that I need from the depresolve phase.
	█ Get depresolve to produce this infomrmaiton, FAST!
	█ Write the graphing code to accept depresolve information up front.
	█ In Main.hs, always run depresolve before graphing, and pass that
	  information to the grapher.

█ Allow available packages to be manually specified.
	█ First step: Always use the greatest available version.
	█ Final version: Actually resolve dependencies.

█ Cleanup
	█ Some code calls `cd`, which changes the working directory
	  of the entire program.
		█ Make this change local to that IO action.
	█ Parse failuers are logged with `traceM`.
		█ This is easy, but shouldn't be used in production.
		█ What's the best way to handle this? WriterT over IO?
	█ This code currently exposes an interface based on lazy IO.
		█ Instead, expose a set of IO actions that give the library
		  consumer control over when things happen.
