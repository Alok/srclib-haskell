█ Remove the code for preprocess-haskell from this source tree.
	█ Read about the sanest way to depend against a local library.

█ Improve the test suite.
	█ Interactive testing with srcco.
		█ Get fast test iterations set up.
	█ I should start doing loose TDD style testing. It makes a ton of
	  sense with this type of program.

█ Strictly separate depresolve from graphing.
  █ Formaize the information that I need from the depresolve phase.
	█ Get depresolve to produce this infomrmaiton, FAST!
	█ Write the graphing code to accept depresolve information up front.
	█ In Main.hs, always run depresolve before graphing, and pass that
	  information to the grapher.

█ Allow available packages to be manually specified.
	█ First step: Always use the greatest available version.
	█ Final version: Actually resolve dependencies.

█ What's the best way to deal with the autotools problem?
	█ I can't parse code without running autotools on some projects.
	█ This makes the process slow and error-prone.
	█ This makes the process system-dependent. It's not a pure function any more!
	█ This forces us to copy the source tree to avoid clobbering it.
	█ This adds a run-time dependency on autotools.

█ Cleanup
	█ Parse failures are logged with `traceM`.
		█ This is easy, but shouldn't be used in production.
		█ What's the best way to handle this?
