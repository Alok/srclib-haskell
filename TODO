█ Remove the code for preprocess-haskell from this source tree.
	█ Read about the sanest way to depend against a local library.

█ Improve the test suite.
	█ Interactive testing with srcco.
		█ Get fast test iterations set up.
	█ I should start doing loose TDD style testing. It makes a ton of
	  sense with this type of program.

█ Strictly separate depresolve from graphing.
  █ Formaize the information that I need from the depresolve phase.
	█ Get depresolve to produce this infomrmaiton, FAST!
	█ Write the graphing code to accept depresolve information up front.
	█ In Main.hs, always run depresolve before graphing, and pass that
	  information to the grapher.

█ Allow available packages to be manually specified.
	█ First step: Always use the greatest available version.
	█ Final version: Actually resolve dependencies.

█ Known-missing header files:
	ghcconfig.h:       unix/**
	HsProcessConfig.h: process/**
	HsNetworkConfig.h: network/**
	HsIntegerGmp.h:    integer-gmp/**
	HsBaseConfig.h:    base/**
	EventConfig.h:     base/**/Event/**
	rts/Signals.h:     base/**
	ghcplatform.h:     base/System/Environment.hs

█ Cleanup
	█ Parse failures are logged with `traceM`.
		█ This is easy, but shouldn't be used in production.
		█ What's the best way to handle this?
